# FEATURE CATALOGUE — Autonomous Crypto Trading System

**Companion to `ARCHITECTURE.md`** (which defines components and contracts). This is the exhaustive
capability list — what the system does, not how it is structured.

**Phase key:** **P0** = before any capital · **P1** = before first live strategy · **P2** = before
second strategy / portfolio · **P3** = scale · **—** = deliberately deferred or declined.

> ⚠️ Items marked **[MISSED]** are ones commonly forgotten until they cost money or time. They are
> the reason this document exists.

---

## 1. Market data & ingestion

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Spot OHLCV + trade tape, multi-venue | P0 | |
| L2 order book depth (20–50 levels) | P0 | Needed for realistic fill modelling, not just signals |
| Perpetual funding rate history + schedule | P0 | Per-venue settlement times differ — this *is* the carry edge |
| Open interest | P1 | |
| Liquidation feed | P1 | Cascade detection, and a signal family in its own right |
| Spot-perp basis / term structure | P0 | Core carry input |
| Mark price vs index vs oracle price, per venue | P1 | **[MISSED]** — Hyperliquid funds on *oracle*, others on mark. Different economics |
| Cross-venue consolidated price, **liquidity-weighted** | P1 | Naive N-source averaging is what broke Mango |
| Stablecoin peg monitor | P1 | **[MISSED]** — USDe hit $0.65 *only on Binance* during Oct 2025 |
| Exchange reserve / netflow | P2 | |
| On-chain data (DEX pools, oracle updates) | P2 | Only if trading DEX venues |
| Macro context (DXY, rates, equity beta) | P2 | Regime conditioning |
| News / social / dev-activity feeds | P3 | Behind the Dual-LLM quarantine |
| Per-feed data-quality score | P1 | **[MISSED]** — feed health as a first-class metric, not an assumption |
| Gap detection + provenance-flagged backfill | P0 | Interpolated candles must be *labelled*, never silently blended |
| Wash-trading discount on reported volume | P1 | **[MISSED]** — never size off raw aggregate volume |
| **Stored bar price validity gate** | P0 | A price of zero is not a price. Binance emits placeholder frames on its trade stream (`p` "0", `q` "0", `X` "NA") and 746 of the first 1,671 bars ate them into `low` via `min()`, every one otherwise looking normal. Measured on what the reader serves, never on what a build reported |
| **Bitemporal store** | P0 | Every row carries event, ingestion and availability time. Append-only — corrections are new rows, never overwrites |
| **Universe watch list across spot, perp and dated-futures segments** | P1 | Added 2026-08-16 at the user's instruction — *"keep an eye on all the universe symbols in all three segments"*. A **watch list**, not a tradeable set: a symbol that goes quiet is kept and marked, because a list that drops what it stopped seeing cannot answer whether the instrument is gone or the feed is. Segment comes from which dataset carries the key, never from parsing a venue or symbol name |
| **Clock-gated access API** | P0 | The only path to data, shared by backtest and live. Serves `availability_time <= sim_clock`; joins key on availability, never event time |

## 2. Feature engineering

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Realized volatility, multi-horizon | P0 | |
| **HAR-RV** | P1 | Beats GARCH-family for short-horizon crypto |
| Depth-weighted order-flow imbalance | P1 | **Never level-1 OBI** — demonstrably spoofable |
| **Absorption detection (delta vs price-hold)** | P1 | **[MISSED]** Positive delta at a high is meaningless if price cannot hold — that is **absorption, not strength**, and is bearish. Raw signed delta is as naive as level-1 imbalance |
| Microprice | P2 | Volume-adjusted variant outperforms the original |
| Kyle's lambda | P2 | Liquidity-regime descriptor for sizing, not a standalone signal |
| Fractional differentiation | P1 | Stationarity without destroying memory. Use `fracdiff` (BSD-3) |
| Triple-barrier labelling | P1 | Barrier width is a hyperparameter — it goes through the Trial Registry |
| Meta-labelling | P2 | Bet sizing / precision. Not an overfitting cure |
| Sample uniqueness + sequential bootstrap | P1 | Overlapping labels violate IID |
| Funding / basis spread features | P0 | |
| Time-of-day, day-of-week, **funding-hour** effects | P1 | **[MISSED]** — funding settles at fixed times, creating predictable flow |
| Cross-sectional ranking across pairs | P2 | |
| Volatility-regime decile | P1 | Feature only — never a gate |
| Correlation / beta to BTC | P2 | |
| Feature staleness timestamp on every value | P0 | **[MISSED]** — a feature must carry when it became knowable |

**Not doing:** the 200-indicator technical zoo. 7,846 rules tested on 100 years of Dow data; the best
failed out-of-sample once corrected for search size.

## 3. Models

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Linear / naive baseline, mandatory** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — every model must beat it before promotion. Cheapest overfitting check that exists |
| Gradient-boosted trees | P1 | Primary workhorse; CPU-native |
| Stacked ensemble | P2 | |
| Meta-model over the experiment ledger | P2 | Learns which strategies work in which regime |
| Champion / challenger with delayed-label comparison | P2 | "Shadow Before Swap" |
| Rolling walk-forward retrain | P1 | Preferred over continual-learning ML |
| Model registry with aliases | P1 | MLflow aliases — registry *stages* are deprecated |
| Deep learning | P3 | Only as a representation front-end feeding a simpler decider |

## 3b. Directional and profit bots — BULL / BEAR / PROFIT-TAIL

**Added 2026-08-03.** Three independent bots per brain, each a full project with its own features,
architecture and training pipeline. Full design: **`bull-bear-profit-agents-spec.md`** (supersedes
`dual-agent-spec.md`). Nine bots at maturity — brain 1's three are built and proven first.

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **BULL bot — long/call side only** | P1 | Independent bot, not a model head. Calibrated P(up) + conviction. Proposes only |
| **BEAR bot — short/put side only** | P1 | Same, opposite side. Short-side position limits stricter than long — a squeeze has no ceiling |
| Trained on **all** data, never direction-filtered | P1 | **[MISSED]** A bull trained only on up-moves has never seen the negative class and cannot calibrate. Specialisation lives in the objective and action space, never the dataset |
| Entry-side labels from **counterfactual triple barrier** | P1 | **[MISSED]** Never train the directional bots on realised outcomes — they did not control the fill or the exit. Judging them on it corrupts the signal |
| Arbiter over the joint distribution | P2 | Meta-labelling. **Trade selection lives here** — the only place a trade is chosen or refused |
| **PROFIT-TAIL bot** | P2 | Third independent bot. Owns entry timing and the entire position after fill. **Cannot reject a selected trade, cannot refuse to close a loser** |
| — `time_the_entry`: joint price + flow-confirmation policy | P2 | Learned jointly, not two rules bolted together. Waits for a level *and* for flow evidence the move is starting |
| — **Signal expiry bound on waiting** | P1 | **[MISSED]** Without a deadline, "not yet" is a silent rejection and the bot takes authority it was denied. Expired = abandoned + logged |
| — **Missed-entry rate as a monitored metric** | P2 | **[MISSED]** A timing bot that misses the biggest movers is failing while its fill prices look excellent. Attributed to PROFIT-TAIL, not to the directional bot |
| — `ratchet_profit_lock`: monotone, volatility-scaled | P1 | Moves only in the favourable direction, never widens, for any model output. Distance is a function of realised vol, not a fixed percent |
| — **Profit lock mirrored venue-side as reduce-only stop** | P1 | **[MISSED]** A lock held only in memory protects nothing during a crash, deploy or partition — exactly when it is needed. Reconciled continuously |
| — `decide_position_action`: HOLD / SCALE_OUT / CLOSE / REQUEST_ADD | P2 | May *request* an add; the arbiter and risk gate decide. May never flip a position — a reversal is a new trade |
| — **Objective is expectancy and tail capture, never win rate** | P2 | **[MISSED]** A win-rate objective teaches it to cut winners and hold losers — the exact inverse of the design, and the mechanism by which "always close in profit" empties an account |
| — **Hard stop overrides PROFIT-TAIL absolutely** | P0 | Risk gate owns it, set at fill, never moved by the bot. Its mandate to close in profit is an objective, not a veto |
| — Advisory `estimate_net_expectancy` / `estimate_loss_tail` | P2 | Inputs to the arbiter and risk gate. Advisory only — a low number makes a trade less likely, it does not kill it |
| Deterministic exit policy as P1 fallback and permanent rollback target | P1 | Immediate entry + triple barrier + ATR trail + ratchet. **Generates the dataset PROFIT-TAIL is later trained on** — the ordering is forced |
| Baseline PROFIT-TAIL must beat | P2 | The deterministic policy above, out-of-sample, per function. Timing may promote while exit does not |
| **Joint Trial Registry across all three bots** | P1 | **[MISSED]** Three searches means ~3× the trials; false-discovery correction uses the *joint* count. Per-bot registries would silently restore the overfitting the gate prevents |
| **Attribution split: signal / timing / exit alpha** | P2 | **[MISSED]** Three bots now share one P&L. Without the split, no bot can be improved or fired on evidence |
| Separate feature namespace, model registry entry and retrain cadence per bot | P1 | Independence at the feature and model layer. **Raw data lake stays shared** — three ingestion paths means three bots disagreeing about the price |
| Per-bot competency level and independent promotion | P2 | A bot at competency 2 gets no capital because its sibling is at 5 |
| Portfolio netting layer above the brains | P2 | Two brains on opposite sides of one symbol pay fees both ways. Activates once a second brain holds capital |

**Model choice is decided by evidence.** Every bot bakes off deep architectures against gradient
boosting and the mandatory linear baseline on this system's own data. Deep is allowed to win, not
assumed to — boosted trees usually beat deep nets on financial data, and transformers lost to a
one-layer linear model on standard forecasting benchmarks.

## 4. Strategy families

| Family | Phase | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Funding-rate carry** | P1 | **Start here** — latency-immune, viable at this size |
| **Spot-perp basis** | P1 | Same |
| Calendar / term-structure spreads | P2 | |
| Directional momentum (minutes–hours) | P2 | Latency-insensitive |
| Mean reversion | P2 | |
| Cross-venue relative value | P3 | Needs same-region VMs |
| Liquidation-cascade fading | P3 | High risk, real edge, needs the venue-health layer first |
| Event-driven (listings, unlocks, upgrades) | P3 | **[MISSED]** — a distinct, under-explored family |
| Statistical arbitrage / pairs | P3 | |
| **Variance risk premium harvest** | P3 | Options. Latency-immune and durable — the strongest options family for this profile |
| Delta-neutral vol / gamma scalping | P3 | Options |
| Covered calls / cash-secured puts | P3 | Options. Simplest entry, but caps upside |
| Skew and calendar/diagonal spreads | P3 | Options |
| Market making / passive liquidity | — | **Closed** — no reachable rebate tier, 10–20× queue disadvantage |
| Latency arbitrage | — | **Closed** — 5–10μs races vs an ~8ms cloud floor |
| Triangular arbitrage | — | Found never profitable after fees in a 2024 Binance study |

## 5. Execution

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Limit / market / post-only / IOC / FOK | P0 | |
| **Reduce-only orders** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — prevents an exit accidentally opening a reverse position |
| Idempotency key on every order | P0 | Client order ID derived deterministically |
| Partial-fill tracking by remaining quantity | P0 | Never a binary filled flag |
| **Cost engine — round-trip breakeven gate** | P1 | Every strategy queries it **before a signal is accepted**. Returns round-trip breakeven for (venue, pair, size, order type), or a typed refusal naming what was missing. A quote resting on a fee nobody fetched reports itself unverified |
| Fee-tier-aware venue routing | P1 | Worth more than any execution algorithm at this size |
| Maker-vs-taker decision per order | P1 | Post-only as cost reduction, not a standalone strategy |
| Per-order slippage budget + abort | P1 | **[MISSED]** — cancel if the book moved past tolerance before ack |
| **Signal expiry / time-in-force discipline** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — a signal computed 5 minutes ago must not fire now |
| Cancel/amend churn limits | P1 | Kraken and OKX penalise churn explicitly |
| **Cross-strategy position netting** | P2 | **[MISSED]** — two strategies taking opposite sides pay fees *both ways*. Net internally before routing |
| Smart order routing across venues | P3 | |
| Iceberg / hidden orders | P3 | |
| TWAP / VWAP / Almgren-Chriss | — | Clips are thousands of times below where slicing helps |
| **Paper execution engine — forward journal, both accountings** | P0 | The paper broker is a *transport* for the order-intent WAL, not a simulator beside it, so paper exercises the code a live transport would run. Every fill is scored under **both** maker-optimistic and taker-pessimistic accounting and promotion gates on the pessimistic one; the gap between them is the realized-vs-assumed fill metric. Running as a supervised process since 2026-08-15 |
| **Participation rate calibrated from the depth archive** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — the share of printed volume a resting order would actually receive. An invented rate is the single cheapest way to manufacture edge, so it is measured from resting size at the touch and carried with `n_observations`; absent a receipt every fill is flagged `uncalibrated` and no tier-2 promotion may read it |

## 5b. Options layer (P3 — required before any options position)

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Full option chain ingestion | P3 | Strikes, expiries, bid/ask, OI per contract |
| **Implied-vol surface fit** | P3 | Skew + term structure. Black-Scholes assumptions fit crypto poorly |
| Greeks computation (Δ, Γ, ν, Θ, ρ) | P3 | Per position **and** portfolio-aggregated |
| **Zomma (dGamma/dVol)** | P3 | **[MISSED]** Third-order Greek. Near the money it runs **negative** — a vol spike drains gamma from exactly where you are positioned, without the underlying moving at all. Combined with the leverage effect (price grinds up as vol bleeds, rolls over when vol wakes), **gamma and direction get hit together** |
| **Greeks-based pre-trade gate** | P3 | **A second risk implementation** — notional limits do not describe an options book. A short-vol position can be tiny by notional, catastrophic by vega |
| IV vs realized-vol spread | P3 | The variance-risk-premium signal itself |
| Put/call skew, term-structure features | P3 | |
| **Pin risk / expiry management** | P3 | **[MISSED]** — positions near strike at expiry behave discontinuously |
| Exercise & assignment handling | P3 | Including auto-exercise rules per venue |
| Delta-hedge scheduler | P3 | Hedge frequency is a cost/risk tradeoff, not a constant |
| Vega and gamma exposure limits | P3 | Portfolio-level, distinct from notional caps |

**Venue reality:** Deribit carries the overwhelming majority of crypto options volume — trading them
seriously means accepting single-venue concentration, directly against the per-venue exposure cap.

**Zomma, quantified** (added 2026-08-02, `instagram-findings.md` → `DbYOQlSFJSZ`). The row above was
written from a caption; the source's own worked example puts numbers on it. Same contract
(S≈30.4–31, K=30, T=90d, r=4.15%):

| Implied vol | Δ | Γ | **Zomma** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15.9% | 0.636 | 0.130 | **−0.749** |
| 8.6% | 0.822 | 0.164 | **−0.373** |

*"Lower vol makes the gamma bell taller and narrower."* Confirms the negative-near-the-money claim
with real magnitudes rather than an assertion.

### Options tooling — do not write these from scratch

Verified 2026-08-02 (versions, licences and star counts checked against PyPI and GitHub, not taken
from the source). **Licence column matters**: GPL-3.0 is stronger copyleft than NautilusTrader's
LGPL-3.0, which §3c of `ARCHITECTURE.md` already flags as a constraint.

| Library | Version | Licence | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Diffrax** | 0.7.2 | Apache-2.0 | Differentiable SDE solvers on JAX. Turns **Heston / rough Bergomi / jump-diffusion calibration from a grid search into a single optimizer call** — gradients flow back through the Monte Carlo paths |
| **py-pde** | 0.58.0 | MIT | Finite-difference PDEs. **Black-Scholes, Dupire local-vol PDE, Fokker-Planck** of a diffusion |
| **FinancePy** | 1.0.1 | **GPL-3.0** ⚠ | SABR, LMM, Hull-White, Bermudan trees, CDS curves, pinned to textbook conventions |
| **vollib** · **pysabr** · **optlib** · **tf-quant-finance** · **PyQL** (QuantLib port) | — | check before use | Option prices, IV, greeks, SABR. Named in `Da8LFnfFnqx`; worth a pass before hand-rolling a vol surface |

## 6. Risk

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-trade gate: notional, leverage, position cap | P0 | Blocks the order *before* it is sent |
| Exchange-side kill switch / dead-man | P0 | |
| Watchdog process + firewall network kill | P0 | Separate process; the bot cannot police itself |
| Per-venue exposure cap (~25–30% of capital) | P1 | |
| **Liquidation-distance monitor** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — for perps this is survival. Alert on margin ratio, not just P&L |
| Margin health / auto-deleverage risk | P1 | ADL can overshoot — one venue expended 8× the actual deficit |
| Graduated drawdown ladder | P1 | Never a single binary kill |
| Correlation-breakdown breaker | P2 | Portfolio-level, leading indicator |
| Volatility-scaled sizing | P1 | Primary sizer |
| Fractional-Kelly ceiling | P1 | Cap, never a target |
| Auto-flatten on venue degradation | P1 | |
| Concentration limit per asset | P2 | |
| **Deployment freeze windows** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — never deploy during high vol or near funding settlement |
| **Adaptive paper tail cap, bounded** | P1 | Added 2026-08-16 at the user's instruction — paper is for practising, so its ceiling adapts to measured drawdowns. **Paper only**: the live ceiling stays the user's and §6 still says no code raises it. Bounded both ways, because a limit derived from recent realised risk rises exactly when risk rises |
| Post-trade reconciliation vs exchange truth | P0 | |

## 7. Portfolio

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Discounted-bandit allocator | P2 | Vanilla Thompson assumes stationary arms |
| Capacity tracking per strategy | P2 | Divergence from a fixed-size shadow book |
| Rebalance scheduler | P2 | |
| **P&L attribution by cost component** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — split gross edge / fees / slippage / funding / impact. You cannot fix what you cannot attribute |
| Attribution by strategy, venue, regime | P2 | |
| Capital sweep to self-custody above a threshold | P1 | Scheduled, not continuous |
| **RMT correlation denoising (Marchenko–Pastur)** | P2 | **[MISSED — added 2026-08-02]** Sample correlation matrices are dominated by noise, and that noise is what portfolio optimisers latch onto. Compare the empirical eigenvalue spectrum against the Marchenko–Pastur bound and **discard eigenvalues indistinguishable from random**; rebuild the matrix from what survives. Without this, "optimal" weights are fitted to sampling error. Source `DYU0dMcpBFP`: *"Most correlations in financial markets are fake… if an eigenvalue looks statistically random, remove it."* Standard technique (López de Prado), not folklore |
| **Constrained optimisation via CVXPY** | P2 | Apache-2.0, v1.9.2. Expresses Markowitz, **CVaR**, tracking-error minimisation and **MIP cardinality caps** in something that reads like the maths; compiles to a cone program (ECOS/SCS/SCIP). Pairs with the row above — denoise the covariance *before* optimising, or the solver optimises noise precisely |
| **Bayesian posteriors via NumPyro** | P2/P3 | Apache-2.0, v0.21.0. NUTS on JAX. **Stochastic volatility, regime detection, hierarchical alpha** — anywhere a point estimate hides the risk that actually matters. Returns a distribution to feed the risk gate, not a single number |

## 8. Validation & research

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Experiment ledger — **including abandoned runs** | P0 | Every statistic depends on the true trial count |
| Trial Registry (cumulative N, enforced) | P0 | |
| Holdout Custodian (refuses queries) | P0 | |
| Purge + embargo, **configured per family** | P0 | Horizons differ by orders of magnitude |
| CPCV harness | P1 | Finalists only — combinatorics explode |
| Deflated Sharpe as in-loop fitness | P0 | Not a report on the winner |
| PBO / CSCV | P1 | |
| MinBTL hard gate | P0 | Cheap, closed-form |
| BH-FDR on the promoted set | P1 | Bonferroni too blunt at large N |
| Hansen SPA at the promotion gate | P2 | "Does the challenger beat the incumbent, corrected for variants tried" |
| Bootstrapped max-drawdown distribution | P1 | Sets non-arbitrary circuit-breaker thresholds |
| Shadow trading with alignment metrics | P1 | ≥95% signal, ≥90% execution match |
| **Regime-coverage tracker** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — gate on having seen a drawdown and a vol spike, not elapsed days |
| Backtest-vs-live divergence monitor | P1 | Technical divergence (bug) vs statistical decay (regime) |
| **Mechanism-health metric per strategy** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — declared at promotion; the only fast decay signal |

## 9. Operations

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Venue health monitor + auto-halt | P0 | |
| Cross-strategy rate-limit budgeter | P0 | Limits are per-IP and exchange-wide |
| Order-intent write-ahead log | P0 | Written *before* the request is sent |
| State recovery from exchange truth on restart | P0 | |
| Clock sync via `chrony` + drift alerting | P0 | Alert well before `recvWindow`, not after rejections |
| Sequence-gap detection on book streams | P0 | Heartbeat proves the socket, not the data |
| Reconnect with full-jitter backoff, honour `Retry-After` | P0 | Bans scale to days and are per-IP |
| Disk / memory / resource watchdog | P0 | Fail loud on disk-full or the WAL dies silently |
| **Bounded writer descriptor pool** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — a writer holds two descriptors per open hour, so they scale with the universe, not with the code. 2,115 symbols needs over 4,000; the recorder inherited a soft `NOFILE` of 1024 from `sudo -H bash -lc`, died on `Errno 24` with exactly 1024 open, and was restarted into the same wall twenty times. Open hours are now an LRU pool sized from the process's own limit. Eviction costs compression, never frames |
| **Cold-start behaviour** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — defined behaviour on first boot with no state |
| **Outage detection — the system's record of its own absence** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — this VM was off 2026-08-10 12:53 → 2026-08-15 17:13 and *nothing checked*: capture wrote nothing, the raw archive skips five days, and every board went on serving a green page dated 08-10. A watcher on the box cannot report that the box is off, so it stamps liveness and records the bounded gap on its first tick back — and the boards age themselves in the reader's browser, because a server-rendered age cannot cover the case where the server is what stopped |
| **Disaster recovery runbook** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — VM dies mid-position: what recovers, in what order |
| Tiered alerting (page / notify / log) | P1 | |
| Structured audit log of every decision | P1 | |

## 10. Security

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Withdrawal permission **never** on trading keys | P0 | Bounds a leak to bad trades |
| IP allowlisting | P0 | Mandatory on Binance for trading-capable keys |
| `sops` + `age` secret management | P0 | |
| Treasury / cold-storage separation | P0 | Separate sub-account, zero API surface |
| Per-venue sub-accounts | P1 | Blast-radius containment |
| Key rotation procedure | P1 | No exchange appears to offer programmatic self-revocation |
| Anomaly detection on own order behaviour | P2 | **[MISSED]** — catches a compromised or runaway bot from the outside |
| **Third-party model weights treated as untrusted binaries** | P1 | **[MISSED — added 2026-08-02]** The moment Kronos is adopted as a zero-shot baseline, we load `NeoQuasar/Kronos-small` from HuggingFace. **Weights are data, and data can carry object code.** The documented technique (`Da1XG9qgd4E`): embed pre-built object code in layers the forward pass **never executes** — the network's behaviour is unchanged, so nothing looks wrong — then link it at deployment. Abstract it to a portable object format and it runs on ARM and x86 alike. This is the **xz-utils playbook**: no malicious source in the repo, just object code shipped as "tests", assembled by the resident linker into an SSH backdoor. Mitigation: **pin by content hash, prefer `safetensors` over pickle, and run inference sandboxed / network-isolated.** Detection tooling for this class is immature — containment is the control, not scanning |
| **Agent-with-wallet blast radius** | P2 | Relevant if any component is ever given spend authority. `DbGFvV0Bwn5` / `Da4XlSfhtNo` describe agents holding their own keys, paying for compute, and self-replicating while solvent. Under Rule 0's cost-of-error buckets this is **"never do" territory** unless capital movement stays behind the human gate |

## 11. Intelligence layer

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dual-LLM quarantine for untrusted content | P1 | Reader has no tools and no credentials |
| **LLM look-ahead guard** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — LLMs know outcomes inside their training window; any LLM-derived signal is contaminated on those dates |
| Research synthesis / literature ingestion | P2 | |
| Automated postmortem writer | P2 | Feeds the ledger |
| Knowledge base / memory | P2 | |
| LLM-authored strategy code | P3 | Sandboxed, gated, never auto-promoted |

> **This section is the thin version.** The full capability space for intelligence, autonomy and
> self-knowledge — 71 candidate features, 39 rated HIGH — is in **`IDEAS-INTELLIGENCE.md`**
> (added 2026-08-02). The ten highest-leverage, in order: belief records with provenance and

> objective · property-based invariants across backtest/shadow/live.

## 12. Governance & compliance

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Manual promote button | P0 | Already decided |
| Config versioning + rollback | P0 | |
| Change log tied to deployments | P1 | |
| **Tax / accounting fill record** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — every fill, timestamped, in an exportable ledger. Painful to reconstruct after the fact |
| **Jurisdiction / venue eligibility check** | P1 | **[MISSED]** — which venues are legally usable, and KYC tier limits |
| Retention policy for proprietary code and data | P1 | Decides whether Fable 5 is usable at all |
| **Observed history sufficient for a promotion** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — a wait with no measured end is indefinite by construction. Days accumulated against the days MinBTL demands at the current trial count. Recedes as N grows, because N only rises; drops sharply at ~30 days when effective breadth first becomes measurable and the gate stops failing closed to calendar days |
| **Learning / reasoning / depth verdict per module** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — §1a.6: *no module ships without an axis verdict*, each pass or fail with the evidence named, and `n/a` is a real answer that must still be said. The verdict is a judgement; what is measured is coverage counted from `src/` (so a module added without one lowers the number) and whether every named artifact exists. A verdict citing a test nobody wrote is the same defect as a ledger row citing a module nobody calls |
| **Reachability audit of every BUILT claim** | P0 | **[MISSED]** — four defects here have had one shape, all flattering: a claim written when the code was written and never re-checked against whether anything calls it. `tail_specs()`; DM-066's dollar-quote filter, BUILT while 539 non-dollar pairs went into bars; the wall's "auto-halt armed" with `observe()` uncalled; five breakers living in docstrings. Tests prove a function works, and a function nothing calls passes its tests forever — so the guard has to point at the *claims*. An `ast` import graph seeded from what scripts invoke, walked transitively so a dead subsystem cannot vouch for itself, cross-referenced against every BUILT/CLAIMED row. Ratcheted in CI in both directions |

## 13. Observability

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Latency histograms per venue and endpoint | P1 | |
| Fill-quality metrics vs assumed | P1 | The number that predicts live degradation |
| Cost breakdown dashboard | P2 | |
| Strategy health board | P2 | |
| Ultra-visual animated node dashboard | P3 | Produces zero alpha; scales with node count |
